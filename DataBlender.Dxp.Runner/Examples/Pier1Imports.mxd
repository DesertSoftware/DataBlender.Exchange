<!-- 
  - QUESTIONS:
  - Do we want to be able to handle multiple intakes in a single file? YES
  - A file consists of a set of instructions and a set of data
  - A file should contain its own description area describing what the file does
  -->

<!-- 
   - Two file types fighting for attention here
   - 1. A template that consists of a set of instructions and a section that can be interrogated
   -    for compatibility or do we have the import provider support a method to determine if it 
   -    is compatible with the data (csv, xml, etc). The scenario is that a user clicks on a csv
   -    file to be imported, we sniff the column headers and determine if a given import provider
   -    can support it based on a collective presence of known column headers
   -    The provider 'I can do this' method works in tandem with the template providing input
   -    instructions about what the minimum presence of column info must be to support an import
   -    The data section contains a placeholder into which the data is inserted 
   -      <data id="datatobeimported" content="System.Data.Csv" source="inline">
   -        <![CDATA[
   -        {{IMPORTDATA}}
   -        ]]>
   -      </data>
   - 
   - 2. A file that contains a complete set of instructions and data to be imported. We have support
   -    for this today.

<!-- 
    Since we now support a multi action import package we can now support dependencies. 
    We only execute root actions in the dependency tree. So the following example would result in the importAlarms action
    being executed by the import manager with the updateAlarmDefinitions run before due to a dependency introduced by the 
    dependsOn attribute

    <updateAlarmDefinitions provider="mxd.Intake.Alarms.UpdateAlarmDefinitions, mxd.Intake.Alarms">
      <instructions>
      ...
      </instructions>
    </updateAlarmDefinitions>
    
    dependsOn is a comma seperated list of dependencies run in the order listed
    <importAlarms provider="mxd.Intake.Alarms.Import, mxd.Intake.Alarms" dependsOn="updateAlarmDefinitions">
